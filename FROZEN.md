**Artifacts**:
- README.md
- checklist.md
- design/TEMPLATE.md
- spec/TEMPLATE.md
- tasks/TEMPLATE.md

**Authority Lock**: The authority hierarchy, invariants, phase model, and freeze semantics defined in README.md are binding and non-reinterpretable.

**Rationale**: Agent Protocol v0.1 specification complete. All foundational tasks (1–9) verified complete. Version tagged as v0.1 in git.
