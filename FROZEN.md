**Frozen By**: Antigravity AI Agent (on behalf of rayyee)

**Artifacts**:
- README.md
- checklist.md
- design/TEMPLATE.md
- spec/TEMPLATE.md
- tasks/TEMPLATE.md

**Rationale**: Agent Protocol v0.1 specification complete. All foundational tasks (1-9) are verified complete. This freeze marks the v0.1 protocol as authoritative and non-reinterpretable. The protocol defines the five-phase workflow, authority hierarchy, freeze mechanism, artifact templates, and preflight checklist with binary verification criteria. Version tagged as v0.1 in git.
